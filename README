# Hawk Compiler Toolchain

# Setup
Hawk requires some dependencies, like the haskell toolchain and llvm 3.5. If developed on Nixos, a nix-shell can be opened in the root directory of Hawk, and will pull in these dependencies. Once the environment is setup, the commands to build are
	cabal sandbox init
	cabal install --dependencies-only
	cabal build

This will build a hawk program in a sandboxed environment.
