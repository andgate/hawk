Comments are the same as in languages like C, Java, C#, and CSS.

### Single Line Comments
Single line comments are marked with `//`.
```
// This is a single line comment.

$ val : Int = 1234 // This comment is at the end of a line

// $ commented_val : Int = 5678 // This line is commented out
```

### Multi-Line Comments
Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.
```
/* This comment
   spans
   multiple lines
   until
   it is closed. */
```
