looks like the pipeline needs some modifications to the inital phase.
The initial phase is responsible for pulling in the current directory tree,
marking what's new or changed (fresh), marking unchanged modules (preserved)
and throwing out whatever is missing (stale).
The rest of the phases (parsing, validation, and typechecking) will then be
applied to the fresh modules. This will allow for incremental compilation.



The entire db needs to be set to stale before this begins.
Pull in a bunch of filepaths and their modification times.
This phase needs to add new modules as fresh, mark modules with new timestamps as fresh,
and modules with the same timestamp as preserved.

The next part is a lot of db work. Fresh modules need to have their items removed, as they
are no longer considered valid.
This might be tricky because preserved dependents on these items are also going to need to
be set to fresh as well. 
Stale modules, and their children (modules and items)
need to be purged from the database.
