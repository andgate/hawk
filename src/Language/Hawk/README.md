## Phases of the compiler
Source text is loaded into memory as one big text document. Then this document is transformed by the compiler into various syntax trees until it is assembly.

# Lexer
Performs lexical analysis upon a given text. Dump tokens as json, yaml, or binary

# Parser
Takes a list of tokens, and produces a list of definitions from the given file.

# Name Checker

# Type Checker

# Code Generator
